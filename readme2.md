Tic Tac Toe Game in Python with Tkinter
A simple yet visually enhanced Tic Tac Toe game built using Python's tkinter library. The game features dynamic styling, color effects, and win/draw detection.

Features
Stylish Player Turns: Player "X" is shown in blue, and Player "O" is shown in red with distinct background colors.
Hover Effects: Buttons change color on hover to provide a more interactive feel.
Smooth Button Click Effects: Buttons change appearance when clicked to simulate a pressed state.
Dynamic Layout: The board resizes automatically when the window is resized.
Win and Draw Detection: The game alerts you when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
Requirements
To run this project, you need:

Python 3.x (ensure you have Python installed on your machine)
Tkinter (should be included by default in Python installations)
Installation
Clone the repository (or download the script):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
Run the script:

Save the file as tic_tac_toe.py (if you haven't already).
Run the script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python tic_tac_toe.py
The game window will open, and you can start playing by clicking on the grid.

How It Works
The game alternates turns between Player "X" and Player "O". Each player clicks on the buttons to place their symbol on the grid.
The game checks for a win after each move by checking the rows, columns, and diagonals for a matching set of symbols.
When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a popup message will appear, and the board will reset for a new game.
File Structure
bash
Copy code
tic_tac_toe.py   # The Python script with the game logic and UI
README.md         # This readme file
How to Play
Player X starts the game.
Click any empty square to place your symbol.
The game automatically switches between "X" and "O" after each move.
The game will notify you when someone wins or if the game results in a draw.
After a win or draw, the board is automatically reset.

Acknowledgements
Thanks to the tkinter library for making GUI applications simple and accessible.
Customizations
You can easily modify the gameâ€™s appearance by changing the color codes or button styles in the script. The current version uses light blue (#add8e6) for Player "X" and light red (#f08080) for Player "O", but you can adjust these values in the script to suit your preference.

This README.md provides a brief overview of how the game works and how to run it. You can customize it further based on your needs.
