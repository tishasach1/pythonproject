# Quiz Application in Python with Tkinter

This is a simple *Quiz Application* built using Python's tkinter library. The application presents multiple-choice questions to the user, checks their answers, provides immediate feedback, and displays the user's score at the end of the quiz.

## Features
- *Multiple Choice Questions*: Displays a set of quiz questions with multiple choice answers.
- *Immediate Feedback*: Provides instant feedback on whether the user's answer is correct or wrong.
- *Score Tracking*: Keeps track of the user's score throughout the quiz.
- *End of Quiz*: Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.
- *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*: User-friendly interface created using tkinter.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x (ensure Python is installed on your machine)
- Tkinter (usually comes bundled with Python by default)

## Installation
1. *Clone the repository* (or download the script):
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-app.git
   

2. *Run the script*:
   - Save the file as quiz_app.py (if you haven't already).
   - Run the script using Python:
     bash
     python quiz_app.py
     

3. The application window will open, and you can start answering the questions.

## How It Works
- The application asks a series of multiple-choice questions with four possible answers.
- The user selects one of the answers and clicks the *Submit* button.
- After submitting an answer, the application provides feedback on whether the selected answer was correct or incorrect.
- The next question is loaded automatically after submitting an answer.
- Once all questions are answered, the final score is displayed in a pop-up message.
- The application then closes automatically.

## File Structure


quiz_app.py    # Main Python script with quiz logic and GUI
README.md      # This README file


## Usage
1. *Start the quiz*: Run the Python script, and the quiz will start.
2. *Select an answer*: Click on the radio buttons to select an answer for each question.
3. *Submit the answer: Click the **Submit* button to check your answer and move to the next question.
4. *View your score*: After all questions are answered, the final score will be displayed in a pop-up.

## Code Explanation
- **QuizApp Class**: This class contains all the logic for loading questions, checking answers, and updating the score.
- **questions List**: Holds the quiz questions, options, and the correct answer for each question.
- **submit_answer Method**: Handles the logic for checking the user's answer and updating the score.
- **load_question Method**: Loads the current question and its options into the UI.
- **show_final_score Method**: Displays the final score once all questions have been answered.

### Customizations
You can easily modify the quiz by:
- Changing or adding more questions to the questions list in the script.
- Adjusting the layout, font, and colors to suit your preferences.
- Adding additional features, such as a timer or sound effects.

This application serves as a great starting point for building a more advanced quiz application in Python.
